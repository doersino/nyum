* `2 tbsp` chili flakes (gochugaru)
* `1 tbsp` gochujang
* `½-⅔ tbsp` soy sauce
* `1 tbsp` cooking oil
* `¼ tsp` pepper
* `2-3 tbsp` rice or corn syrup
* `2 tbsp` water

> Mix in an oven-proof saucepan or cast-iron skillet – you should end up with a thick marinade.

---

* `3-4 cloves` garlic
* `2 tsp` ginger

> Peel, squish with the side of your knife, then finely mince and add to the marinade.

---

* `1` spring onion
* `120-200 g` dry mozzarella

> Slice spring onion into very thin slices. Chop cheese into cubes small enough to melt and brown after a few minutes under the broiler (pre-shredded cheese is fine, too). Keep ready in separate bowls.

---

* `400 g` chicken breast

> Cut meat into `2-3 cm` cubes and mix into the marinade.

---

> Place the saucepan/skillet on medium-high heat. Once it begins to bubble, cook covered for `7-8 minutes` while stirring regularly. Then, reduce heat and continue for another `8-10` minutes. Turn on your oven's broiler halfway through (or however long it takes to reach temperature).

---

> Sprinkle cheese on top and place under the broiler until the cheese has melted and crisped up to your liking – that shouldn't take more than a few minutes. (If you've been cooking in a non-oven-safe vessel, there's nothing wrong with transferring things to a baking dish before this stage.)

---

> Garnish with the spring onion slices and serve.
