--- 
* `225g` plain flour
* `350g` caster sugar
* `85g` cocoa powder
* `1 1/2 tsp` baking powder
* `1 1/2 tsp` bicarbonate of soda
* `2` free-range eggs
* `250ml` milk
* `125ml` vegetable oil
* `2 tsp` vanilla extract
* `250ml` boiling water
* `200g` plain chocolate
* `200ml` double cream
 
> Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins.
>
> For the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the boiling water, into a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, or electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth and well combined.
>
> Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until smooth. (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)
>
> Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the oven for 25-35 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
>
> Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still in their tins, before icing.
>
> For the chocolate icing, heat the chocolate and cream in a saucepan over a low heat until the chocolate melts. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy and thickened. Set aside to cool for 1-2 hours, or until thick enough to spread over the cake.
>
> To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the cake tins to loosen the cakes. Carefully remove the cakes from the tins.
>
> Spread a little chocolate icing over the top of one of the chocolate cakes, then carefully top with the other cake.
>
> Transfer the cake to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with the chocolate icing, using a palette knife.
