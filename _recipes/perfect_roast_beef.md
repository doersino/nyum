* `1.5 kg` topside of beef
* `2 medium` onions
* `2` carrots
* `2 sticks` celery
* `1 bulb` garlic
* `1 bunch` mixed fresh herbs , such as thyme, rosemary, bay, sage
* olive oil
 
> Remove the beef from the fridge 30 minutes before you want to cook it, to let it come up to room temperature.
>
> Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/ gas 9.
>
> Wash and roughly chop the vegetables – there’s no need to peel them. Break the garlic bulb into cloves, leaving them unpeeled.
>
> Pile all the veg, garlic and herbs into the middle of a large roasting tray and drizzle with oil.
>
> Drizzle the beef with oil and season well with sea salt and black pepper, then rub all over the meat. Place the beef on top of the vegetables.
>
> Place the tray in the oven, then turn the heat down immediately to 150°C/130°C fan and cook until the internal temp is 48°C
>
> If you’re doing roast potatoes and veggies, this is the time to crack on with them – get them into the oven for the last 45 minutes of cooking.
>
> Baste the beef halfway through cooking and if the veg look dry, add a splash of water to the tray to stop them from burning.
>
> When the beef is cooked to your liking, take the tray out of the oven and transfer the beef to a board to rest for 15 minutes or so. Cover it with a layer of tin foil and a tea towel and leave aside while you make your gravy, horseradish sauce and Yorkshire puddings.

>
> Place back in the foil to rest again.
