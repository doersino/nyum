title: Pork Schnitzel 
category: European

--- 
* `4` boneless pork loin chops (about 5 to 6 ounces each)
* `1 1/2 cups` all-purpose flour
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* `2` large eggs
* `1/2 cup` milk
* `4 cups` plain dried bread crumbs
* `2 tbsp` extra-virgin olive oil
* `2 tbsp` butter
* `1` sprig thyme
* Lemon wedges
 
> Begin by placing each chop between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and gently pounding them out with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until they are an even 1/4-inch thick.
>
> Put the flour in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs and milk in another shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Put the bread crumbs in a third dish and again season with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge each piece of pork in flour, then in the egg and finally into the bread crumbs, pressing the bread crumbs onto the pork gently so they have a nice even coating.
>
> Lay the breaded pork cutlets in a single layer on a plate lined with parchment and refrigerate, uncovered, for 10 to 12 minutes to allow the coating to dry out a little and adhere to the pork.
>
> Heat oil and butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the thyme sprig and let it fry for about 1 minute to infuse the oil. Remove the thyme sprig and reserve. Gently lay the cutlets into the pan and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with salt and transfer to a serving platter while still hot. Garnish with lemon wedges and the fried thyme sprig before serving.
