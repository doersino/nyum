            <blockquote>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7.</p>
            <p>Place your pork on a clean work surface, skin-side up.
            Get yourself a small sharp knife and make scores about a
            centimetre apart through the skin into the fat, but not so
            deep that you cut into the meat. If the joint is tied, try
            not to cut through the string. Rub salt right into all the
            scores you’ve just made, pulling the skin apart a little if
            you need to.</p>
            <p>Brush any excess salt off the surface then turn it over.
            Season the underside of the meat with a few pinches of salt
            and pepper. Place your pork, skin-side up, in a roasting
            tray and pop in the preheated oven. Roast for 30 minutes,
            until the skin of the pork has started to puff up and you
            can see it turning into crackling. At this point, turn the
            heat down to 170°C/325°F/gas 3, cover the pork snugly with a
            double layer of tinfoil, pop back in the oven and roast for
            a further 4 and a half hours.</p>
            <p>Take out of the oven, take the foil off, and baste the
            meat with the fat in the bottom of the tray. Carefully lift
            the pork up and transfer to a chopping board. Spoon all but
            a couple of tbsp`s of fat out (save it for roast
            potatoes!).</p>
            <p>Add all the veg, garlic and bay leaves to the tray and
            stir them into the fat. Place the pork back on top of
            everything and return to the stove without the foil to roast
            for another hour. By this time the meat should be meltingly
            soft and tender.</p>
            <p>Carefully move the meat to a serving dish, cover again
            with tinfoil and leave to rest while you make your gravy.
            Spoon away any fat in the tray, then add the water or stock
            and place the tray on the hob. Bring to the boil and simmer
            for a few minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
            to scrape up all those lovely sticky tasty bits on the
            bottom of the tray. When you’ve got a nice, dark gravy, pour
            it through a sieve into a bowl or gravy boat, using your
            spoon to really push all the goodness of the veg through the
            sieve. Add a little more salt and pepper if it needs it.</p>
            <p>Serve the pork and crackling with your jug of gravy and
            some lovely roast potatoes (As a treat, you can try roasting
            them in the fat you spooned out of your roasting tray. Some
            stewed red cabbage and a dollop of apple sauce will finish
            this off perfectly.)</p>
