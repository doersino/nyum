            <ul>
            <li><code>150ml</code> milk</li>
            <li><code>150ml</code> hot water</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp</code> sugar</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp</code> rapid rise yeast</li>
            <li><code>250g</code> all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><code>1/2 tsp</code> fine sea salt</li>
            <li><code>2 tsp</code> bicarbonate of soda (baking
            soda)</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Stir the milk and water together and either cool or
            microwave to a temperature of 46C (115F). Add the sugar and
            yeast whisking well to combine. Cover and set in a warm spot
            for ten minutes or until frothy.</p>
            <p>Add the flour and salt. Stir vigorously with a very stiff
            spoon or similar until well combined then continue for at
            least thirty seconds longer. You want to work the gluten
            well for structure here and it will seem almost like a very
            wet bread dough at this point. Cover and return to a warm
            place to develop for sixty to ninety minutes.</p>
            <p>Measure additional warm water – 75ml if using ring forms
            or 25ml if making ‘free form’ crumpets. Stir together with
            the bicarb until completely dissolved. Add to the rested
            batter and stir again until well incorporated. Cover and
            return to a warm spot for thirty minutes.</p>
            <p>Heat a non-stick griddle or pan over medium heat. I
            actually get better results by NOT using butter or oil in
            the pan which tends to overcook the bottoms. Adapt as you
            see fit on this front.</p>
            <p>Use roughly 80ml (1/3 cup) batter for each four-inch
            crumpet. Adjust this amount depending on the size you are
            making. If using rings, measure into them allowing for
            expansion by about a third. If ‘free forming’, slowly and
            gently spoon into a heated pan to make round shapes letting
            the heat of the pan set the edges slightly before putting
            the full measure on each crumpet.</p>
            <p>Getting the temperature just right will take some
            adjustments depending on your equipment but you want the
            edges to be mostly dry with the top just barely cooked
            before the bottom becomes too dark. This should translate to
            five minutes cook time if using rings or about a minute
            shorter for thinner free form examples.</p>
            <p>Ideally you wouldn’t need to flip the crumpet to finish
            cooking but in reality I usually turn mine over for about
            ten seconds at the very end. Alternately the rings can be
            removed in the last sixty seconds so a lid can be placed
            over the pan to finish cooking the tops with steam as
            necessary but don’t cover the pan prematurely or the
            characteristic holes won’t form as well. Some people prefer
            to have the oven broiler turned on to finish the tops so as
            not to sacrifice even a single delightful butter-holding
            hole that appears atop a well-made crumpet. The great
            crumpet finishing debate continues.</p>
            <p>Serve warm with heaps of butter or cool completely on a
            rack and store sealed for up to a week. Reheat briefly in a
            toaster if you’re playing the crumpet long game on later
            days as the tea kettle comes to a boil.</p>
