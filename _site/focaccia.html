            <ul>
            <li><code>9g</code> Instant Yeast</li>
            <li><code>335g</code> Water (105-115 F)</li>
            <li><code>450g</code> Flour (Bread or All purpose)</li>
            <li><code>9g</code> Salt</li>
            <li><code>9g</code> Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Add the yeast to the warm water along with a spoonful of
            the flour. Stir until dissolved. Let stand for 5-10 minutes
            until a light foam surfaces and little bubbles are
            visible.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, add the flour, and salt to a large mixing
            bowl.</p>
            <p>Once the yeast is proofed, pour in the mixture and mix
            the dough with your hands until no dry flour remains in the
            bowl and a cohesive mass forms. The dough will be very
            sticky.</p>
            <p>Pour the olive oil over the dough, work together until
            the oil is absorbed. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.</p>
            <p>Once rested, perform a stretch and fold by grabbing a
            corner of the dough in the bowl, lift straight up to stretch
            the dough as high as it will go without tearing and fold
            over to the other side. Rotate the bowl and perform three
            more reps of stretch and folds. Once folded, turn the dough
            over onto itself, cover and let rest another 25-30
            minutes.</p>
            <p>This is one set of a stretch and fold, perform 3 more
            sets with 25-30 minutes rest in between.</p>
            <p>Drizzle olive oil into a 9x13 baking pan until the bottom
            is covered. After the last stretch and fold, turn the
            focaccia dough into the pan and gently work it to the edges.
            Note: If the dough is springing back from the edges, cover
            and let rest for 15-20 minutes before gently working to the
            edges.</p>
            <p>Cover the pan and let the focaccia proof for 45-60
            minutes. At the end of proofing, the dough should be well
            risen and puffy with gas bubbles. Preheat the oven to
            210degC fan.</p>
            <p>Dimple the proofed dough with wet fingers by gently
            pushing to the bottom of the pan, but do not accidentally go
            through the dough. For me, I like lots of dimples and run
            over the dough 2-3 times.</p>

            <li><code>20g</code> Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Whisk the olive oil and water together with a fork until
            it emulsifies, about 2-3 minutes. Pour the mixture over the
            focaccia where it will pool into the dimples.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle flaky salt and fresh herbs over the top. If
            using other toppings like grape tomatoes, or olives, add
            them now too and gently press into the dough. Note: This
            turns into a great pizza with sauce, cheese and anything
            else you may have in the fridge.</p>
            <p>Place on the middle rack of the 210degC fan oven and bake
            for 20-25 minutes until golden on top. Let rest under a
            cloth on a wire rack for 5 minutes before slicing into hunks
            of focaccia</p>
