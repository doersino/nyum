            <ul>
            <li><code>400g</code> bread flour</li>
            <li><code>10g</code> kosher salt, plus more for
            sprinkling</li>
            <li><code>4g</code> instant yeast</li>
            <li><code>275g</code> water</li>
            <li><code>8g</code> extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to
            coat pans and drizzle</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Combine flour, salt, yeast, water, and oil in a large
            bowl. Mix with hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour
            remains. The bowl should be at least 4 to 6 times to volume
            of the dough to account for rising.</p>
            <p>Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that
            edges are well-sealed, then let rest on the countertop for
            at least 8 hours and up to 24. Dough should rise
            dramatically and fill bowl.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour, then
            transfer it to a well-floured work surface. Divide dough
            into two pieces and form each into a ball by holding it with
            well-floured hands and tucking the dough underneath itself,
            rotating it until it forms a tight ball.</p>
            <p>Pour 1 to 2 tbsp`s of oil in the bottom of two 10-inch
            cast iron skillet or round cake pans. (See note above).
            Place 1 ball of dough in each pan and turn to coat evenly
            with oil. Using a flat palm, press the dough around the pan,
            flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire
            bottom and edges of the pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap
            and let the dough sit at room temperature for two hours.
            After the first hour, adjust an oven rack to the middle
            position and preheat oven to 550°F.</p>
            <p>After two hours, dough should be mostly filling in the
            pan up to the edges. Use your fingertips to press it around
            until it fills in every corner, popping any large bubbles
            that appear. Lift up one edge of the dough to let any air
            bubbles underneath escape and repeat, moving around the
            dough until there are no air bubbles left underneath and the
            dough is evenly spread around the pan.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>`1 1/2 cups pizza sauce, such as our New York-style
            pizza sauce</li>
            <li>`12 ounces grated full-fat, dry mozzarella cheese (see
            note above)</li>
            <li>`Toppings as desired</li>
            <li>`Small handful torn fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
            <li>`2 ounces grated parmesan or pecorino Romano cheese
            (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Top each round of dough with 3/4 cup sauce, spreading the
            sauce with the back of a spoon into every corner. Spread
            evenly with mozzarella cheese, letting the cheese go all the
            way to the edges. Season with salt. Add other toppings as
            desired. Drizzle with olive oil and scatter a few basil
            leaves over the top (if desired)</p>
            <p>Transfer pan to oven and bake until top is golden brown
            and bubbly and bottom is golden brown and crisp when you
            lift it with a thin spatula, 12 to 15 minutes. Immediately
            sprinkle with grated parmesan or pecorino Romano cheese.
            Using a thin spatula, loosen pizza and peek underneath. If
            bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan over a burner
            and cook on medium heat, moving the pan around to cook
            evenly until it is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove the pizzas
            and transfer to to a cutting board. Cut each one into six
            slices and serve immediately.</p>
