            <ul>
            <li><code>450g</code> flour</li>
            <li><code>2 tsp</code> instant yeast</li>
            <li><code>1/2 tbsp</code> olive oil</li>
            <li><code>1/4 tsp</code> kosher salt</li>
            <li><code>1 cup</code> warm water</li>
            <li>cornmeal</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>In the bowl of your stand mixer, combine all of your
            ingredients. Leave out just the cornmeal</p>
            <p>Using the dough hook from your mixer, stir until a loose
            dough forms. If a dough doesn’t form, add a tsp` more of
            warm water. If the dough is extremely wet and sticky, add a
            pinch of flour.</p>
            <p>Attach the dough hook to your mixer and start on a low
            speed. Gradually increase the speed to medium until a ball
            forms. This should take about 30 seconds. If the dough does
            not release from the sides of the bowl, add a pinch of
            flour. If the dough is very dry and flour-y, add a small
            amount of water.</p>
            <p>Once the dough forms into a ball, allow the mixer to
            knead for 8 minutes at medium-high.</p>
            <p>After the kneading is finished, shape the dough into a
            ball, coat with a little olive oil and leave in the mixing
            bowl, covered, for 1 hour.</p>
            <p>After an hour the dough will have risen. Stretch and fold
            the four sides of the dough in on themselves as the focaccia
            recipe, cover and leave for another hour. Repeat twice
            more.</p>
            <p>About an hour before cooking, place your pizza stone in
            the oven on a middle rack. Set the oven as hot as it will
            go.</p>
            <p>Divide the dough in thirds.</p>
            <p>To stretch the dough, pick up the risen dough and gently
            shape into a circle. Do not over-work or fold the dough.
            Drape the dough over both of your knuckles and rotate it
            around, allowing gravity to stretch it into a circle. If the
            dough starts to resist stretching, put it down and allow it
            to rest for a few minutes, at which point it will stretch
            more easily.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle a little bit of cornmeal onto a sheet of baking
            parchment on a pizza peel or rimless baking sheet. Place the
            stretched dough onto the paper and quickly add toppings.</p>
            <p>Slide the paper sheet with the pizza on it onto the
            stone. Remove the paper after a few mins.</p>
            <p>Cook for 5-12 minutes until browned. Enjoy!</p>
